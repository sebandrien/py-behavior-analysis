### **Analysis and Models**

---

This section outlines the implementation and insights derived from the two primary models: Logistic Regression and Linear Regression. These models were designed to explore and predict user behavior and device metrics effectively.

#### **1. Logistic Regression Model**
The Logistic Regression model was employed to classify user behavior into distinct categories based on their phone usage patterns. The primary goal was to predict the **User Behavior Class** (ranging from Light to Extreme usage) using a combination of key features: 

- **App Usage Time (min/day)**
- **Screen On Time (hours/day)**
- **Data Usage (MB/day)**

**Steps for Implementation:**
- The dataset was split into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio with the **train_test_split** function.
- Data was standardized using **StandardScaler** to normalize features for better model performance.
- A Logistic Regression model was trained using the scaled data, with a maximum iteration limit of 500 to ensure convergence.
- The model was evaluated on the testing set, yielding the following metrics:
  - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score**: Demonstrated perfect classification performance across all classes.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: Showed no misclassifications, underscoring the model's reliability.
    
#### **2. Linear Regression Model**
The Linear Regression model was developed to predict **Battery Drain (mAh/day)**, a continuous variable influenced by several usage metrics. This model served as a complementary analysis to understand the relationships between battery consumption and other features.

**Steps for Implementation:**
- The features used for training were:
  - **App Usage Time (min/day)**
  - **Screen On Time (hours/day)**
  - **Data Usage (MB/day)**
- The model was trained on the dataset without feature scaling, as linear regression is less sensitive to scaling compared to logistic regression.
- Predictions for battery drain were generated and stored in a new column, **Battery Prediction**.

**Performance Evaluation:**
- The model's fit was assessed using key regression metrics:
  - **R² (R-squared):** Achieved an excellent score of 0.932, indicating that the model explains 93.2% of the variance in battery drain.
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 174.550, showing that the average prediction error is within a reasonable range.
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** 212.048, further supporting the model's accuracy in predicting battery consumption.

**Insights:**
- The high R² value demonstrates that battery consumption is strongly influenced by app usage time, screen-on time, and data usage.
- This model offers practical applications, such as estimating battery drain for optimizing device performance or providing user insights on energy consumption.

### **Combined Analysis**
Both models complement each other in understanding mobile device usage patterns:
- The Logistic Regression model provides categorical insights, effectively classifying user behavior into meaningful segments.
- The Linear Regression model quantifies the continuous impact of usage metrics, offering precise predictions for battery consumption.

These models together create a comprehensive framework for analyzing and predicting mobile device usage patterns and their impact on user behavior and battery performance.

A correlation matrix is made to better understand the relationship between variables. Strong positive correlations are evident between variables like App Usage Time, Screen On Time, Battery Drain, Number of Apps Installed, and Data Usage, with coefficients close to or above 0.95. This suggests that increased app usage time is highly associated with increased screen-on time, battery consumption, and data usage, as well as a higher number of installed apps. Conversely, the variable Age shows negligible correlation with most other variables, implying that mobile usage patterns are not significantly dependent on the user's age. Lastly, the User Behavior Class is strongly correlated (above 0.97) with all usage-related metrics, highlighting its potential reliance on these factors for classification.

The regression model’s performance is highly commendable, with an R-squared (R²) value of 0.932, indicating that the model explains 93.2% of the variance in the dependent variable. This level of accuracy demonstrates that the linear regression model is well-suited for the data and can reliably predict battery drain based on the given independent variables. The R² score effectively highlights the model's overall performance, while the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 174.550 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 212.048 are within an acceptable range.

This project successfully conducted a behavioral analysis of user phone usage metrics and demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning models in predicting user behavior. App usage time, screen-on time, battery drain, and data consumption exhibit high interdependence, emphasizing their role in understanding user behavior. Age has a negligible correlation with other usage metrics, highlighting the universality of mobile behavior patterns across age groups. Clear distinctions among user behavior classes reinforce the validity of the categorization and provide a robust framework for behavioral segmentation.

Machine learning models performed exceptionally well. The Logistic Regression Model achieved perfect precision, recall, and F1 scores, showcasing its robustness in classification tasks.
